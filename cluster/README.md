# Test cluster

Designed to look like our cluster. Useful for getting to know our architecture, or testing splunk changes to see if they will affect the cluster.

Has:
* 3 idx (up to 15) - Indexers
* 3 sh - Search Heads (Cluster)
* 1 shd - Search Head Deployer
* 1 cm - Cluster Master
* 1 ds - Deployment Server
* 1 api - API Heavy Forwarder
* 1 hec - HTTP Event Collector Heavy Forwarder

Still a WIP.
